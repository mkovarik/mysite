Quantitative finance learners and practitioners are blessed with a large
library of technical literature. It can feel overwhelming. However, most
of the essential practical and theoretical knowledge is contained in
just four books.

### Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives ###
*By John Hull*

This is the go-to tome of finance for the unitiated mathematician.
It is only somewhat technical, but it contains much essential
knowledge and insight of the modern derivatives market.

### Stochastic Calculus for Finance II: Continuous-Time Models ###
*By Steven Shreve*

This is the text that is loved (or hated) by every Rutgers MSMF
student. While Hull provides a perfunctory treatment of stochastic
calculus, it does not cover many essential theoretical results 
(Feynman-Kac, Girsanov, martingale representation theorem) that
quants are expected to be familiar with.

The first volume covers the binomial tree model. I would ignore it.

### Time Series Analysis ###
*by James Hamilton*

Hamilton covers the essentials of time series analysis: calibration,
forcasting, and model selection. These are topics sorely missing from
Shreve. Its nice to have a financial model. But it is worthless if you
cannot validate it.

### Deep Learning ###
*By Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville*

Machine learning skills are becomming increasingly valuable in all
industries. And in quant finance, ML is replacing stochastic calculus
as the essential skillset. This text
