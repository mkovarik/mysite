# Math 111: Statistics II

This course is taught during the Summer of 2017 at Raritan Valley
Community College.

### Who is the instructor?

Michael Kovarik. I am a recent Rutgers graduate (Masters, Mathematics).
This is my first time in a teaching position.

Feel free to email me with any questions or concerns at
[G00213162@raritanval.edu](mailto:G00213162@raritanval.edu). Do *not*
ask me if am related to any other faculty member.

### When does class meet?

Every Monday through Thursday, 08:30 to 10:15 EST, from July 10th to
August 10th.

Students are to attend **all** classes on time. I reserve the right to
fail any student who takes more than three absences. Absence during
a quiz/test will result in a grade of 0.

In the unlikely event that I fail to attend class, students are expected
to regularly check their email for further instructions. 

### What learning materials must I purchase?

The "official" course text is the tenth edition of *Introductory
Statistics* by Neil A. Weiss. Note that its list price is **$224.20**!
This course roughly covers Chapters 8 through 16 of *Introductory
Statistics*.

Since the official text is quite expensive, [OpenIntro Statistics][OIS]
may be substituted. The digital copy of this text is free. A physical
copy only costs $20. This course will more closely follow *OpenIntro
Statistics* than the official text.

Students are expected to supply their own pens and calculators for
tests and quizzes. "Basic" and "scientific" calculators are allowed.
But graphing calculators are forbidden during quizzes, tests, and
the final.

### How much homework will I have to do?

Students are expected to spend an average of **12 hours per
week** on homework and studying. There are three types of homework
assignments:

* **Reading Assignments:** These assignments will require students read
  sections of the official course text or *OpenIntro Statistics*.
  Quizzes may cover material in the reading that has not been
  covered in lecture.
* **Problem Sets:** These can completed with only the aid of a basic
  calculator and numerical tables. It is encouraged that students work
  together on these problems.
* **Labs:** These assignments require analysis of "large" datasets
  (100+ numbers). They can only be feasibly completed with either coding
  or advanced spreadsheet manipulation. Attempt these problems without
  external help.

Students are expected to complete all homework assignments. However, it
will not be factored directly into grading. Student solutions for the
problem sets and labs will be collected. 

### How will I be graded?

Quizzes will be administered during class. I plan to assign
18 quizzes, each worth 2 points. I also plan to drop the three lowest
quiz grades for each student (to account for absences and such). Thus
the quizzes are collectively worth a total of  **30 points**.

There will be two tests. Both will be administered during class. The
first will take place on **July 20th**. The second one on **August
3rd**. Each test is worth 10 points. Thus the tests are collectively
worth a total of **20 points**. Each test will be followed by an
optional "make up" test, which will provide students with the
opportunity to replace their test score with that of the make up test.
These will take place roughly one week after each test.

A final exam will take place sometime between August 11th and August
18th. The time and place are yet to be determined. It will be worth
**30 points**.

At the end of the course, your numerical scores will be converted to a
letter grade. The grading scale is TBD.

### IMPORTANT: Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities should contact the RVCC Office of
Disabilities Services if they are to seek accommodations.

### IMPORTANT: Student Conduct

Students are expected to read, understand, and adhere to the *Student
Code of Conduct* as described in the *Student Handbook*.

In particular, evidence of academic dishonesty of any sort will result
in an automatic failure of the course.
