# July 24

Test I is scheduled for July 24th in class.

* [Review problems](static/review_problems_1.pdf)
  ([Answers](static/review_answers_1.pdf)).

Some tips:

* **Review the reading.** From the results of some of these quizzes,
  I know not all of you are doing your reading. Failing to read the
  textbook is the easiest way to fail this class. And since the reading
  assignments only require a *free textbook*, there is no excuse not
  to do this.
* **Do not cheat.** Cheating results in an "F" for the course.
* **Come to class early.** The test will start at 8:30 sharp. Come early
  to ensure you have the full time to complete the test. You will not be
  given extra time if you come in late. Missing the test will result in
  a grade of "zero".
* **Do the review problems.** I don't intend to through curveballs on
  this test. If you understand how to do the review problems in a timely
  manner, you should score well.
* **Get a good night's rest.** Cramming is less effective than what most
  lazy students believe (I know from first-hand experience). Being well
  rested, however, does wonders for one's focus and endurance.
* **Use the restroom at 8:20**. Once you leave the class, you are not
  allowed to continue your test. This is Department policy.
* **Write neatly.** No credit will be given if I cannot read your
  handwriting.
* **Show your work.** No credit will be given for answers that are
  poorly justified, even if the answers are correct.


### Homework (Due July 25)

Read sections 6.1 and 6.2 of *OpenIntro Statistics* or Chapter 12 of
*Introductory Statistics*. There **will** be a quiz tomorrow on the
readings.
