# Probability Theory

Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that formalizes randomness and
uncertainty. Much of statistics involves calibrating probabilistic models, or
using probabilistic models to forecast future events.

Mathematicians view probability theory as an application *measure theory*, which
generalizes the notion of integration. Under this framework, expectations are
calculated as "Lebesque integrals". I highly recommend *Measure, Integral and
Derivative: A Unified Approach* by Shilov and Gurevich for the technical
details.
