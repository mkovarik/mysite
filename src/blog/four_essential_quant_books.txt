#+TITLE: Four Essential Quant Books

[[../static/img/fourbooks.png]]
Quantitative finance learners and practitioners are blessed with a large
library of technical literature. It can feel overwhelming. However, most
of the essential practical and theoretical knowledge is contained in
only four books.

*** Paul Wilmott on Quantitative Finance

This 1300-page tome covers just about everything that needs to be
known by aspiring quants. It covers the theory and practice of 
derivatives pricing. It is also very opinionated and informal.
It is sorta like /Feynman's Lectures on Physics/, but for finance.

*** The Princeton Companion to Applied Mathematics

It is a good idea to have a broad understanding of mathematical modeling
outside of finance. Technical encyclopedias are really good at doing
that sort of thing.

*** Time Series Analysis

/By James Hamilton/

Hamilton covers all of the essentials of time series analysis:
calibration, forecasting, and model selection. Most financial models are
presented as time series. Stochastic differential equations, for
example, can be thought of as a type of time series model.

*** Deep Learning

/By Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville/

Machine learning skills are becoming increasingly valuable. 
It is quickly replacing stochastic calculus as the most important
technical skill.

Deep learning employs artificial neural nets to make complex decisions.
There are enticing opportunities to profit from this emerging technology.
But very few people (quants included) have any understanding of it. So
deep learning is a new source of opportunity.
