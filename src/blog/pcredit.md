# On Partial Credit

I am currently teaching my second course ("Statistics I"). And my
students have a test coming up in a few weeks. So I have made
an important decision that may prove controversial: *I will
likely not be awarding partial credit for any problems*.

This post is my attempt to justify this decision.

## Why I don't give partial credit

**Reason 1: It is fair.** Let's admit it, teachers have favorites.
Even worse, teachers have *isms*. When awarding partial credit, it
is impossible to eliminate favoritism without a thorough
grading rubric created for each problem *a priori*. Even then, there
are an infinite number of ways for a student to get a problem wrong.
So subjectivity is unavoidable if one is awarding partial credit. 

**Reason 2: It is results-oriented.** Giving partial credits awards
the *process* instead of the *result*. And at the end of the day,
only correct results matter. Would you like to be operated on by a
surgeon who wouldn't be in their position if their professors didn't
liberally award partial credit?

**Reason 3: It is economical.** The previous course I taught had four
students. The vast majority of my time grading was making sure that I
awarded partial credit in a fair manner. I thoroughly compared each
student's solutions to make sure that I was consistent in deducting
points. This took *hours* for just a handful of problems.  This
semester, I have 79 students with no assistant grader.

## How I design/grade tests

Not all problems are appropriate for this style of grading. A problem
that require pages of calculations shouldn't be graded on a binary.
Problems that whose solutions are dependent on solutions of other
problems are equally problematic.

Here are some tips for creating well-designed tests that don't admit
partial credit:

**Make problems small.** A problem should take less than five or
so minutes to complete. Otherwise, a problem would require too many
"steps" to be graded on a binary.

**Make problems independent.** The solution of one problem should not
affect the solution of another problem. Otherwise, a single mistake will
be penalized twice. Coupled with the previous restriction, this can make
it difficult to produce quality tests.

Here is one solution for tech-savvy instructors: suppose problem B
depends on the solution problem A. Write a computer subroutine to
correctly calculate the solution for problem B given a possibly
incorrect solution for problem A. Run this function every time you
grade problem B. Even if a student does not get problem A correctly,
they will receive full marks on problem B if their solution matches the
output of the subroutine. 

**Provide feedback.** It is tempting to only look at the answers when
grading tests. It would certaintly make them very quick to grade.
However, students are entitled to know *where* they made a mistake.
So it is important to check their work and provide clear feedback.

**Be a generous grader.** Students shouldn't feel *punished* because
they had *you* as their teacher. The grade they receive should be
reflective of their abilities, regardless of who is teaching them.
And grading on a binary can only *lower* one's grade. So
grade-inflating mechanisms may need to be applied.

For example, in my upcoming test, I plan to assign twelve problems. Each
problem is one point. However, the maximum score on the test is teb points.
That means students can get two problems wrong and get a "pefect" score.

Other solutions is to make problems easy or to provide a generous curve.
