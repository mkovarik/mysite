### What next?

Statistics is a huge field. And there is much to learn beyond *Statistics
II*. Here are some (highly intersectional) topics that you may want to explore:

* **Mathematical statistics** is statistical theory that uses calculus and linear
  algebra as its foundations. This is often prerequisite for other advanced topics
  in statistics.
* **Computational statistics** involves using statistical software and algorithms
  required to do statistical calculation. This includes algorithms and routines for
  random simulations and numerical linear algebra
* **Multivariate statistics** is the analysis of simultaneous (paired) observations.
  This requires a thorough understanding of linear algebra.
* **Bayesian statistics** is a collection of methods of performing statistical
  inference in a different way to the frequentist methods we learned in class. It
  relies on Bayes theorem from probability theory.
* **Nonparametric statistics** referrs to statistics that does not require knowing
  the underlying distribution (or class of distributions) of the observations.
* **Econometrics** is the application of statistics to economic and financial data.
  It involes regression (linear and logistic) as well as time series analysis.
* **Machine Learning** is the marriage between statistics and artificial intelligence.
  It is oriented towards machines using data to make decisions. In particular, **deep
  learning** uses biologically-inspired "neural nets" to replicate actual intelligence.
  Robots are taking over.

Here are some books to get you started:

* *OpenIntro Statistics* is the course's unofficial official text.
  Its cheap and well written. Many of you have read considerable portions
  of this text. I recommend supporting the project by purchasing a physical copy.
* *Statistics Done Wrong* contains essential advice for doing practical statistics.
* *Book of R* is a practical introduction for using R, a powerful platform for statistical
  computing.
* *All of Statistics* is a concise and comprehensive book on "all statistics" (no really).
  The caveat: you need calculus and linear algebra before seriously attempting this book.


### Statistical careers

Statistics can be a very profitiable skill. Here are just some professions
that require knowledge of statistics:

* **Business Analysts** are often expected to know statistics and data
  analysis to develop profitable business insights
* **Researchers** of all fields need to have a thorough knowledge of
  statistics to do their jobs. This is true for almost any field,
  be it political science or medicine or physics.
* **Engineers** are required to pass the *Fundamentals of Engineering*
  exam, which includes problems from probability theory and statistics.
* **Actuaries** use statistics for calculating risks related to insurance.
* **Statisticians and data scientists** are in growing demand. This is
  due to the rise in *big data*, *cloud computing*, and *artificial
  intelligence*.

Of course, to obtain these careers, you need to be qualified. So here are some
options offered by Rutgers University (to which all of you have indicated is where
you will be transferring to):

(Undergraduate programs)
* [Minor in Statistics](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/minor)
* [Major in Statistics](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/majors)

(Masters programs)
* [Masters in Statistics](http://statistics.rutgers.edu/main/program-home)
* [Financial Statistics and Risk Management](http://fsrm.rutgers.edu/)
* [Data Science](http://msds-stat.rutgers.edu/)

(Other)
* [Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.rutgers.edu/data/)

Alternatively, you don't have to do any of these. Through *Statistics I* and
*Statistics II* here at RVCC, you can probably put "proficient in statistics"
on your resume.


### Last-minute advice

Regardless of your choices, here are some advice for after your transfer:

* **Networking is key** to your future success. Network with students and
  professors. Get a LinkedIn. Print business cards. Companies often host
  information sessions. Go to as many as possible.
* **Build a good work ethic.** This will follow you for the rest of your life.
  Be more self-accountable. Don't procrastinate. Focus on effectively managing
  your time. Build the ability to learn independently.
* **Get an internship.** I stupidly did not do this and makes my job search so
  much harder. The deadlines for Summer 2018 internships are typically in Fall.
