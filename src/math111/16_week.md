# Week 4 (July 31 - August 3)

This week, we cover the statistics involved in the correlation of
numerical random variables. This material is covered in chapter 7
of *OpenInto Statistics* and chapters 14 and 15 of *Introductory
Statistics*. We may also review the concept of statistical power.

The topics covered this week will wrap up the core content of this
course. New material covered after August 3rd will not appear on the
final.

Test II is scheduled next week for August 7th.
