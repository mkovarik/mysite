# Week 2 (July 17 - 20)

This week, we continue our discussion of statistical inference of
numerical data. In particular, we focus on inference of two or more
populations (paired data, inference for two populations means, ANOVA).

This material will cover roughly chapter 5 in *OpenIntro Statistics* as
well as chapters 10 and 16 of *Introductory Statistics*.

**REMINDER:** The first test is scheduled in class for July 24th. Make
ups will likely not be given, so be sure to arrive on time.
