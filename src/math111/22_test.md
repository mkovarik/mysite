Test II is held on August 7th.

Some tips:

* **Arrive early.** Being late to class will mean you have time to complete
  the test. No extra time will be alloted for late-commers. So make
  arrangements to be at RVCC early.
* **Go to the bathroom at 8:20.** Once you leave the classroom, you may not
  continue taking your test. So its best to "take care of business" right
  before the test.
* **Catch up on readings.** Based on quiz performance, I know that not all
  of you are doing your readings. This may hurt your test performance. So
  make sure to read chapters 12 through 15 in *Introductory Statistics*.
  If you don't have the official textbook, you can instead read chapters
  6 and 7 of *OpenIntro Statistics*. You may also want to read the lecture
  notes.

### Homework

If you are willing and able, bring a laptop to class tomorrow. This laptop
should have the R programming language installed.
