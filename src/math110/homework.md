# Homework

Some of these assignments require Pearson's MyStatLab (also called "MyLab
Statistics"). The CourseID for this class is: kovarik24019


### Due before October 24.

1. Do "Assignment 06" in MyStatLab.
2. Study for the make up test, if you plan on taking it.
3. Read chapter 7 (all sections).

### Due before October 17.

1. Ask yourself the following questions:
    
    - Will I complete every homework problem?
    - Will I complete the readings and make thorough notes?
    - Will I put in a MINIMUM of six hours studying each and every week?
   
   If the answer of any of these questions is a "no", my recommendation
   is to drop the course.
2. Read chapter 6 (except 6.5, which is optional).


### Due before October 10

1. Complete "Assignment 05" in MyStatLab
2. Let \\(X\\) be a Binomial random variable with \\(n=6\\) and \\(p=0.4\\).
    - Complete the following table:
      ```
      x | P(X=x)
      --+-------
      0 | ??????
      1 | ??????
      2 | ??????
      3 | ??????
      4 | 0.1382
      5 | 0.0368
      6 | ??????
      ```
    - Use the above table and the following formulas to compute the mean and
      standard deviation of \\(X\\):
      \\[\begin{aligned}
      \mu &= \sum x_i P(X=x_i) \\\\
      \sigma &= \sqrt{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2 P(X=x_i)}
      \end{aligned}\\]
      (Answer: <span class="spoiler">mean = 2.4, stdev = 1.2</span>)
    - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of \\(X\\) by using using the
      following formulas:
      \\[\begin{aligned}
      \mu &= np \\\\
      \sigma &= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
      \end{aligned}\\]
      Do these values match those found in the previous question?
    - Calculate \\(P(X \geq 5)\\) (Answer: <span class="spoiler">4.096%</span>).
3. Study for Test I. The best way of doing so is to review your homework
   (you have been given 73 problems so far), your class notes, and your textbook.

### Due before October 03

1. Complete "Assignment 04" in MyStatLab
2. Read sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 in the course text.

### Due before September 26

1. Complete "Assignment 03" in MyStatLab
2. Let \\(\Omega =\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \\}\\) denote the
   outcome space corresponding to rolling a ten-sided die. And consider
   the following events:
   \\[\begin{aligned}
   A &= \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10   \} \\\\
   B &= \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}
   \end{aligned}\\]
   List all outcomes in the following events:
   - \\(\text{not } A\\) (Answer: <span class = "spoiler">{1,3,5,7,9}</span>)
   - \\(A \text{ or } B\\)  (Answer: <span class = "spoiler">{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}</span>)
   - \\(A \text{ and } B\\)  (Answer: <span class = "spoiler">{2, 4, 6}</span>)
   - \\(\text{not } (A \text{ and } B) \\)  (Answer: <span class = "spoiler">{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}</span>)
   - \\(\text{not } A \text{ or not } B\\) (Answer: <span class = "spoiler">{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}</span>)
3. Read sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 in the course text.

### Due before September 19

1. Complete "Assignment 02" in MyStatLab

```
0.34 0.33 0.26 0.30 0.18 0.29 0.38 0.36 0.27 0.44 0.25 0.35 0.12 0.33 0.18
```
2. Refer to the above data set. Calculate the following:
    - The mean (Answer: <span class="spoiler">0.292</span>)
    - The median (Answer: <span class="spoiler">0.300</span>)
    - The (sample) standard deviation (Answer: <span class="spoiler">0.084870</span>)
    - The five-number summary. (Answer: <span class="spoiler">0.12 0.255 0.292 0.345 0.44</span>)
    - The interquartile range (Answer: <span class="spoiler">0.09</span>)
3. Create a stem-and-leaf plot for the above data set.
4. Read the following sections from the course text: 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2

### Due before September 12

1. Complete "Assignment 01" in MyStatLab.
2. The file [gpa.txt](static/gpa.txt) contains a
   [stem-and-leaf diagram][sl] displaying the grade point
   averages (GPAs) of a sample of twenty students. Calculate
   the sample mean, variance, and standard deviation.
  *Challenge mode*: calculate the sample mean and variance
  by hand. (Answer: <span class="spoiler">mean=2.97, variance =
  1.324, standard deviation =1.151</span>)
3. Read the following sections from the course text: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4,
