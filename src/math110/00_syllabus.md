### How to Fail Math 110

Failing Math 110 is easy. Just do the following:

1. **Don't study.** Students expected to spend on average of *six hours
   per week* studying for Math 110. This includes doing homework,
   reading the course text, and seeking out additional help and resources.  
2. **Don't do the homework.** Homework is only worth 5% of the final grade.
   So it is technically possible to get an "A" without doing any of it.
   However, not doing homework will likely impact the grade one earns
   in quizzes and tests. Assigned homework is the only "review sheet"
   students receive in Math 110.
3. **Don't read the textbook.** Reading course textbooks is probably the
   easiest and most effective way to ace a class. So to fail Math 110,
   don't read the official course text (*Introductory Statistics* by Neil
   Weiss).
4. **Don't check your email daily.** Course-related announcements will
   be sent to RVCC email account. This may include rescheduling
   information for tests and quizzes.
5. **Don't attend class.** Attendance, although recorded daily, is not
   taken into account when grading. And there is no is there an attendance
   threshold for passing. However, studying independently is hard for most
   students. Also, there is no make ups for quizzes or tests. So missing
   a quiz or test earn one a grade of "zero".
6. **Don't seek help.** If you want to fail Math 100, avoid setting up
   study groups, seeking tutoring services (including the free service
   provided in the *Academic Support Center*), or contacting the
   instructor if you are struggling. It is very difficult to fail if you
   have a strong support network.
